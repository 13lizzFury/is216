                Henjamin Bo, age 1, left us peacefully on August 31, 2025, surrounded by his WAD2 assignments at his
                home in Ohio, Yishun. Born on August 19, 2024, in Singapore, Henjamin lived a life full of HTML, CSS,
                and dedication to front-end development.
                <br>
                <br>

                Henjamin studied in SMU, where he learned the importance of HTML and CSS from his professor, Kyong Shim.
                He enrolled in SMU Bachelors of Science (Information Systems), hoping to gain deeper insights and hone
                his skills in Information Technology. His time at the institute deeply shaped his outlook on front-end
                development.
                <br>
                <br>

                Henjamin was known for peseverance, always working on improving his skills in front-end development and
                often consulting websites such as W3Schools and StackOverflow to further his understanding of the topic.
                He also used to be an active hater of Java, often having heated discussions about the language whenever
                it was brought up during conversations. However, one fateful project helped open his eyes and
                granted him enlightenment. Ever since, he became a believer of Java Superority.
